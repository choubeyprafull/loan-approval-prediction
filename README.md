#  Loan Approval Prediction

This project uses **machine learning** and **business intelligence** to predict whether a loan will be approved based on applicant information such as income, employment status, credit history, loan amount, and more. It combines Python-based modeling with Power BI dashboarding to deliver actionable insights for credit risk evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains historical loan application records with the following features:

- Gender, Marital Status, Education  
- Applicant & Coapplicant Income  
- Loan Amount, Loan Term  
- Credit History  
- Loan Status (Target Variable)

## 🚀 Techniques Used

### 🔹 Data Preparation
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature engineering for model robustness

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Distribution analysis and correlation checks

### 🔹 Model Building
- Trained a **Support Vector Classifier**  
- Achieved **83% accuracy** and strong precision on validation data  
- Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
